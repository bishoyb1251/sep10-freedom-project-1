# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Bishoy Bebawy

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of Accounting. I like Accounting for many reasons one being the fact that in order to know accounting you have to know math,science, and other important school things. Accounting is important for mant things including sometimes filing taxes getting applications and even coding.
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study HtMl And CSS and some hints of freecodecamp in order to help me make by website.

## Links
Some links I used were this link [RIGHT HEREEE](https://online.champlain.edu/blog/day-in-the-life-of-an-accountant) ANd more like [THISSS](https://www.futurefit.co.uk/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-pilates-teacher-jo-curran) These sites allowed me to find out what a day of a Accountant is really like. In the first one it talks about a day in the life of an accountant which includes using your Analytical skills. Which brings in math to be able to figure out the numbers. More include Commuting with other Accounting proffesionals.
