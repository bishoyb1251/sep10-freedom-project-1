**choosing**
The topic I decided on for this project is accounting due to the fact that I’ve not always been passionate about this subject but that I was strolling through the options and saw that accounting was an option. Since I saw that it seemed fun because accounters can do what ever they _WANT_ on a computer. Did you know that the accounters are the reason why you get your paycheck at the end of the bi-weekly or weekly paycheck that you get at the end of everytime you get paid?? **cool right??** well according to [this site](https://online.champlain.edu/blog/day-in-the-life-of-an-accountant) it says that "The main goal of accounting is to accurately record and report an organization’s financial performance." So not only does accounting allow paychecks to go around it also allows companys to stay intact by having someone tell them how they are doing with work and and their stocks. Which in my opinion I believe is really cool this is why I chose Accounting as a pathway to write about.

**What can I do to allow people to know what Accounting is?**
What I can do to help accounting is allow people to listen to me and allow it to become bigger. I can also help spread it through the fact of the internet. Anyone who gets paid some way or somehow gets their paycheck by some Accountant. _very cool right_.

**Attention to detail**
Did you know if you mess up in grammar it could be very bad. Not realizing that accounting can bring down economys because well it kind of runs the economy and cash purposes. When I was researching about accounting I saw that accountitng can make alot of things go wrong if one thing is not right.

**skills**
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, _how to google_, and communication.
